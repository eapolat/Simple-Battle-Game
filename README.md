# Simple-Battle-Game
A Java game which contains useful examples about inheritance; abstract and super classes.

In the program there is a abstract class called Unit. Each of the characters in the program are subclasses of the Unit. So, in the Unit class, the common features of the characters can be seen.

There are 7 characters in the game: Archer, Bard, Healer, Necromancer, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard. Each of them has different abilities for each phase.

In Arena class, program creates random units for both user and computer. Also there is a battle method which runs the codes for each phases end check if characters are dead. In addition, (to make the battle method run) there are some additional methods in the Arena such as checkGameEnded and checkTheDead.

Lastly, there is a Main class where the user can run the program. It creates the game, counts the turns and takes an input to make the user choose which character to put in battle arena.

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
